# First Day to formally learn Git

(actually second time, since I did it in my second year of college)

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that is used to track changes in code. It is a distributed version control system, which means that it allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time.

## How to use Git?

1. Install Git on your computer.
2. Create a new repository on your computer. This can be done by running the command `mkdir <Create Your Directory>` and `git init` in the terminal.
3. Create a new file in the repository and add it to the staging area. This can be done by running the command `git add <File Name>` in the terminal.
4. Commit the changes to the repository. This can be done by running the command `git commit -m "Commit Message"` in the terminal.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository. This can be done by running the command `git push origin master` in the terminal.
